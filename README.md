# CodeFit

## Problem Statement
1. India has 6,214 engineering and technology institutions which are enrolling 2.9 million students.
2. A recent article by Times of India quoted that only seven percent of engineering graduates are employable.This is because of the lack of confidence and lack of preparation by the students who appear for interviews. 
3. Experts say that this may cause serious instability in the economic and social conditions in the country. Nearly, 1.5 million jobless engineers in India are passing out every year. And hence we came up with this portal which will help the students to prepare well for their interview by which they will feel more in control, and help them boost their confidence to a high level eventually giving them a better chance to secure their job. 
4. This portal will help in bridge the growing gap between an engineering student and the companyâ€™s expectation
