File System<br>

A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage such as magnetic disks, magnetic tapes and optical disks. In general, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines or records whose meaning is defined by the files creator and user<br>

File Structure <br>
A File Structure should be according to a required format that the operating system can understand<br>
●A file has a certain defined structure according to its type<br>
●A text file is a sequence of characters organized into lines<br>
●A source file is a sequence of procedures and functions<br>
●An object file is a sequence of bytes organized into blocks that are understandable by the machine<br>
●When operating system defines different file structures, it also contains the code to support these file structure. Unix, MS-DOS support minimum number of file structure.<br>

  <br><br><b>Security in Operating System</b><br>
  Security :

Security refers to providing a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, memory, disk,
software programs and most importantly data/information stored in the computer system. 
If a computer program is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc. We're going to discuss following topics in this chapter<br>
●Authentication<br>
●One Time passwords<br>
●Program Threats<br>
●System Threats<br>
●Computer Security Classifications<br><br>
